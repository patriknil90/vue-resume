      How fun that you've found my site and want to read about me! If I would describe myself I would say that I'm structured, organized, forward-looking and goal-oriented. I guess you could say that I always want to see a clear path ahead and that I prefer strategies over ad hoc. I have an agile approach to life which means that I believe in incrementally developing myself, processes, teams or other things to better achieve greatness. I strongly believe in doing what I love to contribute as much as I can. In my career, I love to develop business applications as a Front End developer.<br><br>In my spare time I like to exercise, go to seminars and meetups, listen to podcasts and have as many extraordinary experiences as I can, be that of experiencing a new part of the world, trying out new food or meeting new exciting people.<br><br>I'm always open to new relationships. If you would like to connect with me, don't hesitate to add me on <a
